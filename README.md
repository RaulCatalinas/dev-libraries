# Dev Libraries

### 1. Description

**`Dev Libraries`** is an **`open-source`** project https://www.devlibraries.dev/, where you can find alternatives to libraries depending on the language you are working in. A web site to help the developers and provide the best options of libraries at the moment to work on projects.
